    description: `This is where I made my first professional PR. Designers serve closer to a Product Designer and a UI Developer at the same time. We start from conducting user research, rapid prototype and wireframe. Rapid as in we usually go straight to high fidelity within the first two weeks of a new project. And each project only has one single dedicated designer for all prototyping and ideation needs. On the code front, some of us are better traversed in Front End code and would do native animation, or new componentry, but most of what we do is CSS on either the web or native front. I have personally been expanding my responsibilities to start evaluating user stories based on business metrics/values and not soely on user experience as well as promoting more collaboration from within the designers (since we are all very silloed) and between designers and product management team. I've also started organizing workshops that includes every department to crowd source ideas based on Google Venture's Design Sprint methodologies.`,

    role: 'Visual Designer',
    description: `Dauntless's design team consisted of a design lead and two designers. The projects were very complex and very large in scope. As a small company, it is pretty much expected that you'd be doing things you weren't exactly expecting to on the day of hire. That one thing here was QAing our designs post development and help write test cases. Unlike other designers, I had the developers help me build the projects on my local host and used inspector to provide the corrected CSS instead of just a verbal description. This kind of paved the way for my position at Synapse since my corrections could have literally been pushed up for a PR instead of having it passed to devs for them to commit the PR.`,

    description: `I started doing freelance and contract work as soon as I finished my UIUX courses. And as expected, I've had to hop around for quite a bit before I am able to find a stable gig. Most of my contract jobs were through Creative Circle and most companies only needed early UX research and low fidelity wireframe. I still do some freelance jobs on the side, but it is mostly only for family and friends.`,

I started just essentially as an errand boy but by the time I left, I was actually supervising the whole jobsite managing sub contractors, handling sub contractors' schedules, communicating with architects and clients all at the Baltimore Airport where there's extra red tape around building a restaurant behind those TSA security scanners.`,

I ended up receiving an A for this class which I don't have proof of because it just says P on my transcript.`,
